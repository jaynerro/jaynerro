## General info
Jaynerro is first of all my pseudonym but it is also this project : my Knowledge Base put in the form of a web site.

## Technologies
Project is created with
* php: 8.0
* Bootstrap: 5.0.2
* Vanilla Javascript

## Setup
* Cloning the project

I am using MAMP to interact with the web page. Go to https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/ if you want to download it. Then you need to clone the projet in MAMP/htdocs and run Apache to display the web page.

## About me
As a recently graduated cybersecurity engineer, I learn about cybersecurity on a daily basis, both in my job and through self-study. My goal is to centralize my acquired knowledge in one place so that I can find it whenever I want and keep track of my learning.

This is why I created Jaynerro : to gather some concepts of Cybersecurity and more precisely on the offensive security / Ethical Hacking for those who are interested.
